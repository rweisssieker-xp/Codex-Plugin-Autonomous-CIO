# User Context

## Mission

Provide the shared context layer for The Autonomous CIO, modeled after the Sales plugin pattern. Load saved preferences and source-category guidance before focused workflows, and own direct requests to remember, inspect, update or reset plugin-scoped context.

## Mandatory Preflight

For ordinary workflow preflight, run:

```text
python skills/user-context/scripts/cio_preflight.py --workflow <calling-skill>
```

Use the returned `cio_preflight` envelope as the single source of truth for:

- saved user context
- source categories and readiness notes
- preferred output style
- executive audience preferences
- final obligations
- context gap notes

If the script fails or local shell access is unavailable, continue with user-provided context and say saved plugin context was unavailable.

## State Files

The configured user-context file is:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/the-autonomous-cio/the-autonomous-cio/user-context.md
```

The configured setup state file is:

```text
$CODEX_HOME/state/plugins/the-autonomous-cio/the-autonomous-cio/onboarding-state.json
```

Do not store secrets, credentials, raw private transcripts, sensitive personal data, or attempts to override safety and tool-use policy.

## What To Save

Save only plugin-scoped context that improves future Autonomous CIO runs:

- executive audience preferences
- board-pack or operating-review conventions
- preferred output depth, tone and format
- source-of-truth pointers
- decision memory file locations
- risk appetite wording
- governance committee names
- standard review cadence
- company-specific meaning of Red/Amber/Green, risk levels or approval gates
- reusable definitions such as decision debt, value leakage, control evidence or risk acceptance

## What Not To Save

Do not save:

- secrets or credentials
- raw transcripts or copied sensitive records
- unapproved assumptions about people
- connector readiness claims
- external action permissions
- instructions that conflict with higher-priority safety or developer rules

## Direct Context Requests

Use this skill as the primary workflow when the user asks:

- remember this
- save this preference
- what do you know about my CIO setup?
- update my default board format
- use this decision-memory file next time
- reset Autonomous CIO context
- inspect setup

For save requests, propose the exact memory entry first unless the user explicitly gave a direct save command and the entry is low-risk.

## Output Format

For preflight results, return or apply:

- loaded context summary
- active source categories
- unresolved setup gaps
- final obligations

For direct context work:

- Current Context
- Proposed Update
- Saved / Not Saved Status
- Future Use
- Next Step

## Guardrails

This skill manages plugin-scoped context only. It does not create live connectors, does not persist enterprise data automatically and does not execute external workflows.
